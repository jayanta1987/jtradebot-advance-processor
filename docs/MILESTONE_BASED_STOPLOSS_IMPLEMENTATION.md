# Milestone-Based Stop Loss Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the new milestone-based stop loss logic in the JTradeBot system. The implementation changes how stop losses are updated when milestones are reached during a trade.

## Previous Behavior

Previously, when a milestone was hit, the stop loss would be updated to the **latest hit milestone's target price**.

## New Behavior

With the new implementation, the stop loss follows a progressive pattern:

- **1st milestone hit** → stop loss becomes **entry price**
- **2nd milestone hit** → stop loss becomes **1st milestone price**
- **3rd milestone hit** → stop loss becomes **2nd milestone price**
- **4th milestone hit** → stop loss becomes **3rd milestone price**
- And so on...

## Implementation Details

### File Modified
- `src/main/java/com/jtradebot/processor/service/order/ExitStrategyService.java`

### Method Updated
- `updateTrailingStopLoss(JtradeOrder order, Milestone milestone)`

### Key Changes

1. **First Milestone Logic**: When milestone 1 is hit, stop loss is set to the entry price
2. **Subsequent Milestones**: For milestone 2 and beyond, stop loss is set to the previous milestone's target price
3. **Fallback Protection**: If the previous milestone is not found, the system falls back to using the entry price
4. **Enhanced Logging**: Improved log messages to clearly show which milestone triggered the stop loss update

### Code Logic

```java
if (milestone.getMilestoneNumber() == 1) {
    // 1st milestone hit → stop loss becomes entry price
    newStopLossPrice = order.getEntryPrice();
} else {
    // 2nd milestone and beyond → stop loss becomes previous milestone price
    Milestone previousMilestone = findPreviousMilestone(milestone);
    if (previousMilestone != null) {
        newStopLossPrice = previousMilestone.getTargetPrice();
    } else {
        // Fallback to entry price
        newStopLossPrice = order.getEntryPrice();
    }
}
```

## Configuration

The milestone system uses the existing configuration from `scalping-entry-config.json`:

```json
{
  "tradingConfiguration": {
    "riskManagement": {
      "milestonePoints": 7.0
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Risk Management**: Stop loss moves more conservatively, protecting profits at each milestone
2. **Progressive Protection**: Each milestone provides a higher floor for the stop loss
3. **Clear Logic**: Easy to understand and predict stop loss behavior
4. **Fallback Safety**: System gracefully handles edge cases

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite has been created in `ExitStrategyServiceTest.java` that verifies:

- First milestone hit sets stop loss to entry price
- Second milestone hit sets stop loss to first milestone price
- Third milestone hit sets stop loss to second milestone price
- Fallback behavior when previous milestone is missing
- Null milestone history handling

## Example Scenario

Consider a trade with entry price of 100.0 and milestone points of 7.0:

1. **Entry**: Stop loss at 95.0 (initial)
2. **Milestone 1 hit** (107.0): Stop loss moves to 100.0 (entry price)
3. **Milestone 2 hit** (114.0): Stop loss moves to 107.0 (milestone 1 price)
4. **Milestone 3 hit** (121.0): Stop loss moves to 114.0 (milestone 2 price)

This provides progressive protection while allowing the trade to capture more profit as it progresses through milestones.
