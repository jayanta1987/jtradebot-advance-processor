### 2. âœ… Extracted TradingSignalProcessorService (400+ lines)
**Responsibilities:**
- Process trading signals for a given tick
- Evaluate entry decisions with pre-calculated indicators
- Validate and execute orders based on entry decisions
- Log real entry logic and market analysis
- Handle scenario-based entry evaluation

**Key Methods:**
- `processTradingSignals(Tick indexTick)` - Main entry point
- `evaluateEntryDecision(Tick tick, FlattenedIndicators indicators)` - Optimized evaluation
- `validateAndExecuteOrder(Tick tick, ScalpingEntryDecision entryDecision, FlattenedIndicators indicators)` - Order validation

**Optimizations:**
- ðŸ”¥ Calculate indicators ONCE per tick to avoid redundant calculations
- ðŸ”¥ Calculate market condition analysis ONCE per tick
- ðŸ”¥ Calculate entry quality scores ONCE to avoid redundant calculations
- ðŸ”¥ Use passed entry quality instead of recalculating

### 3. âœ… Extracted OrderExecutionService (300+ lines)
**Responsibilities:**
- Create new trade orders and save to DB
- Check and process exits for existing orders
- Update live P&L for active trades
- Manage order lifecycle and state

**Key Methods:**
- `createTradeOrder(Tick tick, String orderType, ScalpingEntryDecision entryDecision, ...)` - Order creation
- `checkAndProcessExits(Tick tick)` - Exit processing
- `updateLivePnL(Tick tick)` - P&L calculations
- `canExecuteNewOrder()` - Order validation

**Features:**
- Live option pricing support
- Placeholder pricing fallback

### 5. âœ… Updated TickProcessService (Reduced from 1593 to ~800 lines)

### 6. âœ… Fixed All TODO Items in TradingSignalProcessorService

### 7. âœ… Enhanced TradingSignalProcessorService Readability

### 8. âœ… Extracted Category Analysis Logic from TickProcessService
**Major Improvement:**
- ðŸ”¥ **Created CategoryAnalysisService** (300+ lines) - Dedicated service for all category-wise counting and analysis
- ðŸ”¥ **Removed 250+ lines** of category counting logic from TickProcessService
- ðŸ”¥ **Eliminated Code Duplication** - Category counting logic was duplicated across multiple services
- ðŸ”¥ **Improved Separation of Concerns** - TickProcessService now focuses purely on tick processing, not business logic

**What Was Extracted:**
- âœ… `getCategoryCountsMap()` - Category counts for scenario evaluation
- âœ… `getEmaCount()` - EMA count calculations for CALL/PUT strategies
- âœ… `getFutureVolumeCount()` - Future & Volume count calculations
- âœ… `getCandlestickCount()` - Candlestick pattern count calculations
- âœ… `getMomentumCount()` - Momentum indicator count calculations
- âœ… `getConditionCounts()` - Category-based condition counts
- âœ… `getCallCategoryCounts()` - CALL strategy category counts
- âœ… `getPutCategoryCounts()` - PUT strategy category counts

**Benefits:**
- **Cleaner TickProcessService**: Now focuses purely on tick processing orchestration
- **Centralized Category Logic**: All category analysis in one dedicated service
- **Better Testability**: Category logic can be unit tested independently
- **Reduced Complexity**: TickProcessService reduced by ~250 lines
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service has a clear, focused purpose
**Improvements Made:**
- ðŸ”¥ **Step-by-Step Processing**: Broke down `processTradingSignals()` into 4 clear steps
- ðŸ”¥ **Modular Methods**: Each step is now a separate, focused method
- ðŸ”¥ **Performance Monitoring**: Added timing for each operation
- ðŸ”¥ **Structured Logging**: Replaced inline logging with dedicated logging services
- ðŸ”¥ **Data Classes**: Created `MarketConditionAnalysis`, `EntryAnalysisResult`, `EntrySignalResult` for better data flow
- ðŸ”¥ **Error Handling**: Improved exception handling with proper logging

**New Structure:**
1. **Step 1**: `calculateIndicators()` - Get market data and calculate indicators
2. **Step 2**: `analyzeMarketConditions()` - Analyze market conditions
3. **Step 3**: `processEntryLogic()` - Process entry logic and generate signals
4. **Step 4**: `handleOrderManagement()` - Handle order management

**Benefits:**
- **Readability**: Much easier to understand the flow
- **Maintainability**: Each step can be modified independently
- **Testability**: Each step can be unit tested separately
- **Performance**: Built-in performance monitoring
- **Debugging**: Better error tracking and logging
**Issues Resolved:**
- âœ… Moved `getDetailedEmaStatus()` to `IndicatorStatusService`
- âœ… Moved `getDetailedRsiStatus()` to `IndicatorStatusService`
- âœ… Moved `getVolumeStatus()` to `IndicatorStatusService`
- âœ… Moved `getEntrySignal()` to `IndicatorStatusService`
- âœ… Moved `getEntryProximity()` to `IndicatorStatusService`
- âœ… Moved `getTrendAndConditionsInfo()` to `MarketDirectionAnalysisService`

**New Services Created:**
- **IndicatorStatusService** (200+ lines) - Handles all indicator status formatting
- **MarketDirectionAnalysisService** (400+ lines) - Handles market direction analysis and trend evaluation
**Changes:**
- ðŸ”¥ Delegates to new specialized services
- ðŸ”¥ Maintains backward compatibility
- ðŸ”¥ Reduced complexity by ~50%
- ðŸ”¥ Added delegation methods for easy migration

**New Delegation Methods:**
- `canExecuteNewOrder()` â†’ `orderExecutionService.canExecuteNewOrder()`
- `getActiveOrders()` â†’ `orderExecutionService.getActiveOrders()`
- `updateLivePnL(Tick tick)` â†’ `orderExecutionService.updateLivePnL(tick)`
- `checkAndProcessExits(Tick tick)` â†’ `orderExecutionService.checkAndProcessExits(tick)`
- `getNiftyTickInfo()` â†’ `tickOrchestrationService.getNiftyTickInfo()`
